    3. To use the Quartus II, you need to configure the Software Licence. The license server is already
    installed in the tesla server. If you are in the University Network, you can directly connect to it and
    verify your license. However, if you are not in the University Network, you need to connect to it via
    a VPN Network. (Please follow the instructions here, and connect to the Department VPN before the next step.)<br>
