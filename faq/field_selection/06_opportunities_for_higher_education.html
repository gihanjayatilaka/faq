<faq>
    <question>
        Do you prepare graduates for higher education?
    </question>

    <answer>
        We prepare & encourage all our graduates to do higher studies and get foreign exposure so that they can go on to do better & bigger things (dream higher). We have several major projects in our programme, and the last one (final year) is a research project which helps students prepare for higher education. A lot of our Computer Engineering graduates go for PhDs all over the world. To give an example, one of our graduates who went for a PhD has won <a href="https://www.acm.org/media-center/2020/june/src-2020-grand-finals">third place</a> last year in a global competition among research students, <a href="https://src.acm.org/grand-finalists/2020">right below</a> two PhD students from MIT and Virginia Tech. This competition is run by the largest professional organization for Computing, known as the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).

    <question>
        What are the required qualifications and experience for enrolling in a higher degree programme?
    </question>

    <answer>
        A good GPA (needs to be above 3), a good research profile (which is covered with 3rd year & final year projects), and a good overall portfolio/profile (which we will help you to build with many curricular & extra-curricular activities). Further, the better your GPA and the more quality publications you have the better chance of getting high ranked Universities. There are other factors such as having good recommendations and really good marks at standardized tests (e.g., GRE, TOEFL, IELTS, etc.), as well.

    <question>
        Can we do higher education in electronics after completing the computer engineering degree?
    </question>

    <answer>
        Yes, you can choose to specialize in electronics domains. Some of our best students are getting into the electronic area. A good example is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsha-ganegoda">Harsha Ganegoda (E/10 batch)</a> who was working for NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville during his graduate studies. Further, this is one of <a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/marcs/our_team/research_students/titus_jayarathna">our graduates</a> who built a <a href="https://westernweekender.com.au/2020/05/medical-breakthrough-new-way-to-monitor-vital-signs">smart T-shirt with electronics</a> in it for medical-related application.

    <question>
        Can we get into higher education and research in the field of embedded systems after graduating with a Computer Engineering degree?
    </question>

    <answer>
        Yes, we have many of our graduates who have done higher degrees in embedded systems and actively working in research. For example, Hasindu Gamaarachchi is working on building <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/news-events/news/computer-scientist-working-improve-genomic-testing">a portable embedded device to do DNA sequencing</a> “on the fly”, working for a medical research institution in Sydney Australia.
