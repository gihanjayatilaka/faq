    <question>
        I like to join the Computer Engineering degree programme. But I only have a little knowledge of programming. Is that going to make a difference?
    </question>

    <answer>
        As long as you are up to the challenge, willing to work hard, it is not an issue at all. We have statistics to prove that a lot of very good Computer Engineering graduates did not have any programming knowledge before joining.

    <question>
        Are there any courses that you will recommend us to do during these days so that we can improve some basic skills regarding the field?
    </question>

    <answer>
        You don't need to learn anything specific. We teach everything needed. If you have spare time, you can try and do some extra programming work, or learn some basics about C, C++, Java, Assembly. You can also try some simple programming project, reach out to our lectures and they will be more than happy to guide you. Or else just use the spare time for some fun hobby.
