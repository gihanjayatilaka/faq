            Our primary target is to help Students to build their qualities which are related to the IT field and expected by the industry
        to achieve that we join hands with ACES and conduct "Pre-DATATHON", "Pre-CODERS" competitions and events to make students ready to make their move in the grand event.
        Furthermore we host Developer Series sessions and Competitive Programming sessions to give primary knowledge that students need to have as a competitive future employee in IT sector. Also we Conduct workshops in collaboration with leading companies in the industry which helps undergraduates to experience the real deal.
        We do not limit to all technical stuff. We organize an intra faculty FPS gaming competition "WARZONE" which brings students together and have fun while fighting for the victory.
