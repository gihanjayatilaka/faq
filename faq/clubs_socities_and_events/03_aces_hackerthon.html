    Aces Hackathon is one of the signature events that is organised annually by the Association of Computer Engineering Students. This event provides a platform for the competitors to come up with innovative ideas for a new product or to give a solution to a problem. This is one of the best opportunities the participants get to publicise their new ideas, to get an insight into the business world as well as to get an industrial exposure.
